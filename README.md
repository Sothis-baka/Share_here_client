### Consideration

The reason not using Redux

> The only global states used is the user login status, which is only checked once if no request is made

Debounce

> Skip the submit event if loading is true

Use set up status code in server to know mutation result for convenience

Use local storage to store JWT. 

> React is XSS protected (except for some dangerous use)
>
> Unlike cookies, tokens won't be sent automatically with request (safer to CSRF attack)
>
> If there is sensitive data/action, should add more protection (mostly in back end, front end is never safe, if exposed to XSS attack, attackers can do anything on behalf of the user.) 

compress icon before use

If multiple state need to update, combine them together. Use a copy of object so that diff function can quickly distinguish.

Responsive design

> â€‹	Auto focus on input
>
> * feedback
>
>   All hover, focus on interactable component will have some effect
>
>   When a request is submitted, show loading animation
>
>   If input is not valid, show error message immediately
>
> * screen size
>
>   For login page, I only changed the font size so that it can fit into a mobile screen
>   
>   For register page, conceal the icon in smaller screen and adjust layout from horizontal to vertical
